# Machine Learning to Deep Learning Tutorial
Using Jupyter notebooks and various datasets we are able to see through the whole machine learning to deep learning landscape. The notebooks are arranged in order.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have installed python first and foremost. You can install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

### Virtual Environment
** Optionally you can create a virtual environment for your machine learning projects. If not skip this step and head over to install all the packages [here](#install-packages).

```
python -m venv ml
```
After creating the virtual environment you'll need to activate the virtual environment with the command below depending on your terminal:
```
~/ml/Scripts/activate
```
or
```
~/ml/Scripts/activate.bat
```
or
```
~/ml/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

### Install Packages

Install all the packages needed:

```
pip install jupyterlab pandas numpy matplotlib tensorflow apyori xgboost
```
